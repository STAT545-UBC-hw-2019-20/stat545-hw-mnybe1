# Ex1. Univariate data reshaping
## Option 1 - Exploring life expectancy for ...
### 3 components of the task:
### 1. Putting the data in wider format
### 2. Producing a plot of the wide data
### 3. Re-lengthening the wide data

### A tibble
#### 1. Make a tibble with one row per year, and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  select(country, lifeExp, year) %>%
  filter(country == "Australia" | country == "Japan") %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = year,
              names_from = country,
              values_from = lifeExp)
  
```


### A scatter plot
```{r}

```


### Re-lengthen the data
```{r}

```
